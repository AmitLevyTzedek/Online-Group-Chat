### About
I developed an online chat platform. This endeavor revolves around establishing communication between a server and a client, incorporating a database. Consequently, numerous individuals can simultaneously join either a new or existing group

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Encryption
* Socket Programming

## How to run the project?
To begin, execute the server.py file. Once the server.py file has been run, proceed to run the client.py file for each individual user.

## Users Actions
* Kick users (only for admins!)
